# Readme
This is a simple script that pulls DFES information in our area. This was created after seeing some people
in our area badmouth the response time of our local volunteer firefighters. Just made for fun / to learn, but 
may be useful.

You will need to use pip3 to install the feeparser file

__pip3 install feedparser__

## TODO

- Create menu where users can choose from all areas
